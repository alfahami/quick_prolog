/* 
    Lists are used to store the atoms as a collection
    Lists can either be empty [] or non-empty [atom, hello, 12,[]]
    Consist of two things
    
    Head : first item of the list
    Tail : the remaining part of the list, and can be another list in case of multiple elements

    L = [a, b, c], Tail = [b, c] then L = [a | Tail]
    [a, b, c] = [x | [b, c]]
    [a, b, c] = [a,b | [c]]
    [a, b, c] = [a,b,c |[]]

    List is a DATA STRUCTURE that consists of two parts, the head and a tail. The tail itself has to be a list
